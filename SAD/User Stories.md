# usage scenarios: drive application features

## Scenario 1

I hear about a cool new series/movie/game but either i have no access to the net, don't have enough data/space or the download is taking too much time or just lazy. How do I find out which of my friends already have a copy or are downloading it?

## Scenario 2

I have a cool new series/movie/game and I want to brag to everyone i know

## Scenario 3
I want to free up space but not lose a certain series/movie/game. How do I find out who else has it and ask them not to delete it while I delete mine.

Similarly i want to avoid a situation where i realy want something only to find out my friend has just deleted it.

## Scenario 4
I'm bored and I want to look at what cool series/movies/games my friends are into

## Scenario 5
I have a movie/series but it's low quality. How do I find out if my friends have a better quality copy?

## Scenario 6
I don't care about what the rest of the world has, i only want to know what my friends - who i can access, have. Friends who live closer to me would be more accessible
